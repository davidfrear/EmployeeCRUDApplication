The database is an important part of any application. Without a database, an application is just like a human without a brain.
One of the most basic scenarios in real life would be a simple CRUD app that would interact with the database and help us to
store and manipulate data.

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

A CRUD application is one that uses a GUI to get data in and out of a database

In this project, I will create an Employee CRUD Application which will have the following functionalities,
- Insert and store employee details such as Employee ID, Employee Name, and Employee Department in a database using MySQL
- Perform various other operations such as fetching data, deleting data, updating existing data, and more
- Showing all the available data in the database
- A simple GUI interface to perform all the above operations

In this project I will be using all the major python programming concepts such as; lists, dictionaries, strings, loops,
conditionals, and more.
Also implementing the concepts such as GUI using Tkinter and Database connectivity.

The first step is to create a simple GUI that will help me interact with the application and perform operations over the database.
The GUI would have the following options to Insert,Update,Fetch, and Delete the Data. Also, we would have a Reset option which will reset all the fields.
I will add a window to show the data in real-time whenever a operation is performed.

Starting on MySQL first and create the required Employee database and the table to store the employee details.
Therefore, I will create an Employee database with empDetails table in it. Which will hold the following fields;
- empID - this field will store the employee ID and will be of INT type.
- empName - this field will store the employee name and will be of VARCHAR type
- empDept - this field will store the employee department and will be of VARCHAR type
